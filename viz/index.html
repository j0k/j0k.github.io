    Here I will collect different ideas and vizualization implementations. Take attention on design, structure, color, labels, ...
    <p>
      Try to think in terms of that table for each vizualization:
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Term</th>
        <th>Comments</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Areas</td>
        <td>Biology, Math, Social, Law, Design, Animation, Music, Physics, Tactics...</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Complexity</td>
        <td>How complex is it (Liker scale)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Tooling</td>
        <td>Where and how you can create it. What is the easist way. Code snippets</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Authors</td>
        <td>How used for the first time</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Users</td>
        <td>Who use it</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Coolness</td>
        <td>Why it's cool</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Attention</td>
        <td>Which part of the image you can identify or recognise</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Interactivity</td>
        <td>Can you play with it? Can you make it interactive?</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Source</td>
        <td>Can you play with it? Can you make it interactive?</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Date</td>
        <td>Original and when it added to the site.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Timeline</td>
        <td>How much time do you see on the image?</td>
      </tr>
