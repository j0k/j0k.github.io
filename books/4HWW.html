      <li>The 4-Hour workweek wa turned down by 26 out of 27 publishers. // p. xii </li>
      <li>Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time
        to pause and reflect. // - Mark Twain, p.5</li>
      <li>Anyone who lives within their means suffers from a lack of imagination. //
      Oscar Wilde (Irish dramatist and novelist), p.5 </li>
      <li>The DEAL of deal making is also an acronym for the process of
       becomig a member of the New Rich. (p.10)</li>
       <li>D for Definition</li>
       <li>E for Elimination</li>
       <li>A for Automation</li>
       <li>L for Liberation</li>
       <li>An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made
         in a very narrow field. // Neils Bohr, Danish physicist and Nobel Prize winner</li>
       <li>Reality is merely an illusion albeit a very persistent one. // Albert Einstein</li>
       <li>So, what makes the difference? What separates the New Rich,
         characterized by options, from the Deferrers (D), those who save it all
         for the end only to find that life has passed them by?
         <br>
         It begins at the beginning. The New Rich can be separated from the crowd based
         on their goals, which reflect very distinct priorities and life philosophies. (p.20)
       </li>

       <li>
         D: To reach the big pay-off, whether IPO, acquisition, retirement, or other pot of gold.
         <br>
         NR: To think big but ensure payday comes every day: cash flow first, big payday second.
       </li>

       <li>
         The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are easiest
         person to fool. // Richard P. Feyman, Nobel Prize - winning physicist
       </li>

       <li>
         Civilization had to many rules for me, so I did my best to rewrite them. // Bill Cosby, p.24
       </li>

       <li>
         Rules that change the rules
       </li>

       <li>
         Everything popular is wrong. // Oscar Wilde, The Importance of Being Earnest
       </li>

       <li>
         I can't give you a surefire formula for success, but I can give you a formula for failure:
         try to please everybody all the time. // Herberd Bayard Swopes, p.28
       </li>

       <li>
         Being the Game, not Playing the Game (p.28)
       </li>

       <li>
         1. Retirement is the Worst-Case-Scenario Insurance
       </li>

       <li>
         2. Interest and Energy are cyclical
         <br>
         If I offered you $10.000.000 to work 24 hours a day for 15 years and then
         retire, would you do it? Of course not - you couldn't. It is unsustainable,
         just as what most define as a career: doing the same thing for 8+ hours
         per day until you break down or have enought cash to permanently stop.
         <br>
         The NR aims to distribute "mini-retirements" throughout life instead of
         hoarding the recovery and enjoyment for the fool's gold of retirement.
         By working only when you are most effective, life is both more
         productive and more enjoyable.
       </li>

       <li>
         3. Less in not Laziness
         <br>
         Doind less meaningless work, so that you can focus on thingsof great personal Importance.,
         is NOT laziness. This is hard for most to accept, because our culture tends to reward
         personal sacrifice instead of personal productivity.
       </li>

       <li>
         4. The Timing is Never Right
         <br>
         I once asked my mom how she decided when to have their first child, little ol'me.
         The answer was simple: "It was something we wanted, and we decided there was no
         point in putting it off. The timing is never right to have a baby." And so it is.
         <br>
         For all of the most important things, the timing always sucks. (p.33)
       </li>

       <li>
         5. Ask for Forgiveness, Not Permission
         <br>
         If it isn't going to devastate those around you, try it and then justify it.
         <br>
         People - whether parents, partners, or bosses - deny things on an emotional basis
         that they can learn to accept after the fact. If the potential damage is moderate
         or in any way reversible, don't give people the chance to say no. Most people
         are fast to stop you before you get started but hesitant to get in the way if you're
         moving. Get good at being a troublemaker and saying sorry when you really
         screw up.
       </li>

       <li>
         6. Emphasize Strengths *
       </li>

       <li>
         7. Things in Excess Become Their Opposite.
       </li>

       <li>
         8. Money Alone in Not the Solution
       </li>

       <li>
         9. Relative Income Is More Important Than Absolute Income
       </li>

       <li>
         10. Distress Is Bad, Austress is Good
       </li>

       <li>
         You have comfort. You don't have luxury. And don't tell me that money plays a part.
         The luxury I advocate has nothing to do with money. It cannot be bought.
         It is the reward of those who have no fear of discomfort. // Jean Cocteau, French poet,
         novelist, boxing manager and filmmaker, whose collaboration were the inspiration for the
         term "surrelalism". p.44

       <li>One doesn't accumulate but eliminate. It is not daily increase but daily
       decrease. The height of cultivation always runs to simplicity. // Bruce Lee </li>

       <li>Perfection in not when there is no more to add, but no more to take away. //

         Forget all about time-management. In the strickest sense, you shouldn't be trying to do more
         in each day... Being busy is most often used as a guise for avoiding the few ctitically
         but uncomfortable actions.

         The key to having more time is doing less, and there are two paths of
         getting there, both of which should be used together:
         (I) Define a to-do list and (2) define a not-to-do list. In general
         terms, there are but two questions:
         <br>
          1. What 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappines?
          <br>
          2. What 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness?

       and doesn't matter if you're 50+. Remember that that the real goal
       is not to get numbers, but to get over the fear of asking, so the outcome is
       unimportant.</p>

        In the beginning, the sheer newness of it is exciting enought to keep
        things interesting at all times. Once you have learned the basics, though,
        it becomes clear that to be even a half-decent player requires some serious
